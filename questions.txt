0.  What is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis?
-It is the longest word in the English language with 45 characters.

1.  According to its man page, what does getrusage do?
-Returns resource usage measures for who.

2.  Per that same man page, how many members are in a variable of type struct rusage?
-16

3.  Why do you think we pass before and after by reference (instead of by value) to calculate, even though we’re not changing their contents?
-Passing in a reference avoid making unnecessary copies of the before and after structs.

4.  Explain as precisely as possible, in a paragraph or more, how main goes about reading words from a file. In other words,
convince us that you indeed understand how that function’s for loop works.
-For each char that we get from file (fgetc) and till the end of the file (!= EOF) check if alphabetical/apostrophe (withing LENGTH) it is or decimal digit.
We ignore words with numbers. If it is a letter, the character will be inserted into the WORD array at the INDEX position.
After, INDEX is incremented to go to the next position in the array. If a character is not alphabetical/apostrophe or a number then it must be the end of the word.
After all characters are checked, it terminates current word and updates counter of words.
check() returns true if word is in dictionary else false. misspelled stores the word, if check() returns false.

5.  Why do you think we used fgetc to read each word’s characters one at a time rather than use fscanf with a format string like "%s" to read whole words at a time?
Put another way, what problems might arise by relying on fscanf alone?
-fscanf doesn't check each character and might return a string with invalid characters (comma).

6.  Why do you think we declared the parameters for check and load as const (which means "constant")?
-The const type ensures that the initial value of the parameter cannot be modified.
This means that each word we are checking along with the dictionary cannot be changed.
