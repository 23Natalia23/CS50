1.  What’s stdint.h?
stdint.h - integer types
The <stdint.h> header declare sets of integer types having specified widths, and shall define corresponding sets of macros.
It shall also define macros that specify limits of integer types corresponding to types defined in other standard headers.

2.  What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?
The typedef name int N _t designates a signed integer type with width N, no padding bits, and a two's-complement representation.
Thus, int8_t denotes a signed integer type with a width of exactly 8 bits.
You can fill up exactly the amount of space you want in a file.

3.  How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?
typedef uint8_t  BYTE; = 8 bits = 1 byte
typedef uint32_t DWORD; = 32 bits = 4 bytes
typedef int32_t  LONG; = signed 32 bits = 4 bytes
typedef uint16_t WORD; = 16 bits = 2 bytes

4.  What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."
The first two bytes of a BMP is a WORD and denotes bfType, which specifies the file type. It must be set to the signature word BM (0x4D42) to indicate bitmap.

5.  What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?
bfSize is the total number of bytes in the file (246 for smiley.bmp).
biSize is the number of bytes in the info header (40 for a bitmap).

6.  What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
If biHeight is positive, the bitmap is a bottom-up DIB (device-independent bitmap) and its origin is the lower left corner.
If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB and its origin is the upper left corner.

7.  What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?
biBitCount

8.  Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?
We just check if there is file. So if there is not we can not open it.

9.  Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
Because it specifies how many elements you want to read, and we're always reading a struct, so we only need 1 struct.

10. What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?
int padding =  (4 - (bi.biWidth * sizeof(RGBTRIPLE)) % 4) % 4 = 3

11. What does fseek do?
Sets the file position of the stream to the given offset.

12. What is SEEK_CUR?
This is the position from where offset is added. It is specified by one of the following constants:
SEEK_SET	Beginning of file
SEEK_CUR	Current position of the file pointer
SEEK_END    End of file
